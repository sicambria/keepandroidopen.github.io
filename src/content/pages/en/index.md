In August 2025, Google [announced](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification) that as of September 2026,
it will no longer be possible to develop apps for the Android platform
without first registering centrally with Google.
This registration will involve:

- Paying a fee to Google
{:.li-list .li-money}
- Agreeing to Google's Terms and Conditions
{:.li-list .li-terms}
- Providing government identification
{:.li-list .li-id}
- Uploading evidence of the developer's private signing key
{:.li-list .li-signing}
- Listing all current and future application identifiers
{:.li-list .li-appids}

## What this means for your rights

➤ You, **the consumer**, purchased your Android device believing in Google’s promise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run whatever software you choose on it. Instead, as of September 2026, they will be non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that irrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement over what software you are permitted to trust.

➤ You, **the creator**, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with your friends, family, and community without first seeking Google’s approval. The promise of Android — and a marketing advantage it has used to distinguish itself against the iPhone — has always been that it is “open”. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the Android ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can now jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.

➤ You, **the state**, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital sovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the extrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal apps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the running of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the opaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation.

### Update: Google has **not** "backed down" from developer verification {#clarification}

Contrary to a vague [mention](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html) of a possible "advanced flow" that may eventually allow "experienced users to accept the risks of installing software that isn't verified", Google's [description of the program](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification) continues to state plainly that:

> Starting in September 2026, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed on certified Android devices

Until such time that they have shown evidence that it will be possible to bypass the verification process without undue friction, we must believe what is stated on their official page: that **all** apps from non-registered developers **will be blocked** once their lock-down goes into effect.

### Update: Google has revealed the "advanced flow" — it is not a solution

On March 19, 2026, Google published details of the "advanced flow" the mechanism intended to allow installation of applications from unverified developers after the mandate takes effect. This flow requires enabling Developer Mode, self-attesting that you are not being coerced, restarting your device, and waiting a mandatory 24 hours before being permitted to install applications from unverified sources. Critically, the entire flow is delivered via Google Play Services — not the Android OS — meaning Google can modify, restrict, or remove it at any time without an OS update and without user consent.

The advanced flow has still not appeared in any Android beta, dev preview, or canary release. As of the date of this update, it exists only as a blog post and UI mockups. The community is being asked to accept a product announcement as a functional safeguard five months before the mandate takes effect.

Until Google provides a shipping implementation that can be independently verified, the position of this site remains unchanged: **all** apps from non-registered developers **will be blocked** once their lockdown goes into effect in September 2026.

## How you can help {#help}

### Developers: Resist and refuse {#developers}

If you are an app developer, _**do not sign up**_ for the early access program, perform identity verification, or accept an invitation to the Android Developer Console. Respond (politely) to any invitation with a list of your concerns and objections.

—— _It is only through developer acquiescence and capitulation that their takeover plan can possibly succeed._ ——

Discourage fellow app developers and organizations from signing up to the program. Use community forums, social media, and blog posts to spread the message. Include the [FreeDroidWarn library](https://github.com/woheller69/FreeDroidWarn) in your code to inform your app users. If you manage a web site, consider [adding the countdown banner](/banner) to the top of your page.

If you are a Google employee or contractor of good conscience and have additional insight about the program, including planned technical implementation details or additional rationales for the program, please reach out to [tips@keepandroidopen.org](mailto:tips@keepandroidopen.org) from a _non-work_ machine and a _non-gmail_ account. Your information will be kept in strict confidence.

### Everyone: Make your voice heard {#everyone}

- [Install F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) on your Android device(s). The more people that use alternative app marketplaces, the harder it will be to shut them out.
- Provide feedback directly to Google using their [Android developer verification requirements survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN3UQeNspQsZCO2ITkdzMxv81rJDEGGjO-UIDDY28Rz_GEVA/viewform?pli=1).
- Make your voice heard on social media and with blog posts, and link to <https://keepandroidopen.org>
- Combat astroturfing: when you encounter suspect posts on community forums and social media in support of the policy (“Well, actually…”), challenge them and do not be shy.
- Help this project out by [editing this page](https://github.com/keepandroidopen/keepandroidopen.github.io/blob/main/src/content/pages/en/index.md) with more useful information.
- [Sign this change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/stop-google-from-limiting-apk-file-usage/)

### Web Site Owners: Show your support {#webmasters}

[Add the countdown banner to your site](/banner) with a single `<script>` tag — no dependencies, 20 built-in localizations, fully customizable.
